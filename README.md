## ðŸŒ¿ About

**Welcome to my Neovim configuration!**

After a lot of research, trial and error, and fine-tuning, Iâ€™ve crafted a setup that Iâ€™m confident in. Neovim is an incredibly powerful, fast, and customizable text editor, and this configuration leverages that power to provide a smooth and efficient development experience.

This configuration is designed to be highly modular and customizable, with full language support, integrated formatters, linters, and plugins.

## ðŸ”§ Setup

To install the Neovim config, clone the repository in your `~/.config/nvim`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AzureHex/Startpage.git ~/.config/nvim
```

### ðŸš€ Why This Configuration?

This configuration came from frustration with the slow, inefficient nature ofÂ **VSCode**. After switching toÂ **Neovim**Â in late 2023, I was impressed by its speed, customizability, and seamless workflowâ€”and Iâ€™ve never looked back. Neovim's flexibility allowed me to craft a setup that perfectly fits my needs, delivering a fast, efficient, and smooth development experience. Lightweight yet powerful, this configuration provides optimal performance across various languages and workflows. After a lot of trial and error, this is the setup I trust for all my development work.

Feel free to fork and modify it to suit your own needs. Hopefully, it makes the Neovim experience just as enjoyable and productive as it has been for me!
